THIS FILE SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH AN ISSUE TRACKER ONCE A GIT HOST IS DECIDED

· Should Selector and Sequence reset children further along in the sequence
  once a child causes it to return early? If not, do we add a special node
  specifically for that?
· Do I need to make sure nodes return `self.status` if they aren't Running?
  I'm thinking no... Child nodes may change due to world state.
· Add tests for each node type plus nodes linked together
