THIS FILE SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH AN ISSUE TRACKER ONCE A GIT HOST IS DECIDED

· Should Selector and Sequence reset children further along in the sequence
  once a child causes it to return early? If not, do we add a special node
  specifically for that? Perhaps leave that open to the user since we have
  exposed the Node trait?
· Do I need to make sure nodes return `self.status` if they aren't Running?
  I'm thinking no... Child nodes may change due to world state. Perhaps that
  just means the control nodes do this but leaves don't (this sound correct at
  this moment).
· Add tests for each node type plus nodes linked together
