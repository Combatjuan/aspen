= Aspen: Behavior Trees in Rust =

This is an implementation of behavior trees in Rust.
It is largely based on behavior trees as described by Marzinotto et al. footnote:[Marzinotto, Alejandro, et al. "Towards a unified behavior trees framework for robot control." Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2014 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2014.] and was designed for use on an actual robot using http://www.ros.org/[ROS] and https://lcm-proj.github.io/[LCM] for communication.

A nice overview of behavior trees can be found on http://www.craft.ai/blog/bt-101-behavior-trees-grammar-basics/[Craft AI's website].

This is both my first actual Rust crate and has yet to be used on an actual robot.
Feedback would be very much appreciated.
